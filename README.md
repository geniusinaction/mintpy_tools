# mintpy_tools
A bunch of things I wrote that are useful for MintPy output

[load_geo_h5_files.ipynb](https://github.com/geniusinaction/mintpy_tools/blob/main/load_geo_h5_files.ipynb) $-$ a simple demo of loading HDF5 files output by MintPy, which can be useful

[load_and_extract_timeseries.ipynb](https://github.com/geniusinaction/mintpy_tools/blob/main/load_and_extract_timeseries.ipynb) $-$ how to read in a time series and extract time slices or compute differential time series

Dependencies:
* MintPy
* matplotlib
* gdal
